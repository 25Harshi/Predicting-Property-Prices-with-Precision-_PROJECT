# Predicting-Property-Prices-with-Precision-_PROJECT

🏡 Predicting Property Prices with Precision

This project focuses on predicting real estate property prices using Machine Learning techniques. It covers the complete data science workflow — from data cleaning and EDA to feature engineering, model building, and interpretability.

📊 Project Overview

Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand trends, outliers, and correlations.

Engineered key features and handled missing values, categorical encoding, and scaling.

Trained and compared multiple ML models — Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

Selected the best-performing model based on RMSE, MAE, and R² Score.

Generated a Final PDF Report summarizing metrics, visuals, and SHAP interpretability insights.

🧠 Tech Stack

Languages: Python

Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, xgboost, shap, reportlab
